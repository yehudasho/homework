In this home assigments I was asked to create an echo-system which can run on  multiple environments.
1.	Deploy MySQL & Kafka on a K8s cluster
2. 2.	On the MySQL initial startup the container will import SQL file containing the data that will later on be shipped to Kafka from the following location
3.	On the Kafka initial startup the container will create topics that will later on be used by the consumer\producer services.
4.	Deploy the 2 data shipper services on the same K8s cluster
 	Containerize the services following Docker best practices and the build guidance in the Github repository.
